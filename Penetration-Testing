# 🔴 Penetration Testing – Beginner Guide

This repository is a beginner-friendly introduction to penetration testing.

Goal:  
Understand how ethical hackers test systems and learn the core skills required to become a penetration tester.

No prior experience required.  
Technical, practical, and beginner accessible.

## 🎯 What is a Penetration Tester?

A penetration tester (ethical hacker) simulates real-world attacks to find security weaknesses before malicious attackers do.

A pentester:

- finds vulnerabilities
- exploits misconfigurations
- tests defenses
- reports risks
- helps organizations improve security

The job is not “hacking for fun” —  
it is structured, legal, and professional security testing.

## 🧠 Core Skills You Must Learn

A good penetration tester understands:

✅ Linux  
✅ Networking fundamentals  
✅ Web technologies  
✅ Operating systems  
✅ Scripting basics  
✅ Security tools  
✅ Problem solving  

Tools are secondary.  
Understanding systems is primary.

## ⚡ The Penetration Testing Workflow

Every pentest follows a structured methodology.

### 1. Reconnaissance

Gather information about the target.

```
nmap <target>
whois <domain>
dig <domain>
gobuster dir -u http://target -w wordlist.txt
```

Goal: map the attack surface.

---

### 2. Enumeration

Extract deeper information from services.

```
nmap -sC -sV <target>
enum4linux <target>
nikto -h http://target
```

Goal: identify weaknesses.

---

### 3. Exploitation

Use vulnerabilities to gain access.

```
searchsploit <service>
msfconsole
sqlmap -u "URL" --dbs
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt ssh://target
```

Goal: prove the vulnerability is real.

---

### 4. Privilege Escalation

Gain higher access after initial compromise.

```
sudo -l
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
linpeas.sh
```

Goal: move from user → root/admin.

---

### 5. Post-Exploitation

Maintain access and analyze the system.

```
cat /etc/passwd
history
crontab -l
```

Goal: understand the impact.

## 🧰 Essential Beginner Tools

```
nmap        → network scanning
burpsuite   → web testing
nikto       → web vulnerabilities
gobuster    → directory discovery
hydra       → brute force testing
metasploit  → exploitation framework
wireshark   → network analysis
```

Tools help — but mindset matters more.

---

## 🧪 Practice Platforms

You must practice in safe environments.

Recommended:

- virtual machines
- home lab
- CTF challenges
- security labs
- vulnerable machines

Reading alone does not create skill.  
Hands-on work does.

---

## 🧠 Beginner Learning Strategy

1. Learn Linux first
2. Learn networking basics
3. Understand how web apps work
4. Practice scanning and enumeration
5. Break systems in labs
6. Read writeups
7. Repeat

Consistency beats intensity.

---

## 🎯 Realistic Expectations

Penetration testing is hard.

You will:

- fail often
- get stuck
- feel confused
- learn slowly

This is normal.

Skill grows with time, not shortcuts.

---

## 🔥 Beginner Milestones

If you can:

✅ scan a machine  
✅ find open services  
✅ exploit a basic vulnerability  
✅ escalate privileges  
✅ explain what happened  

You are on the right path.
