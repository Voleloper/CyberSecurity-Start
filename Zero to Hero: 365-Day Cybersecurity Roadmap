- [ ] **Brute Forcing:** Learn **Hydra** and **John the Ripper**.
- [ ] **Platform:** Start the "Pre-Security" and "Jr. Penetration Tester" paths on **TryHackMe**.

### 🟡 Month 6: Privilege Escalation
You are in. Now become God (Root/Admin).
- [ ] **Reverse Shells:** Understand how to catch a shell with Netcat (`nc -lvnp`).
- [ ] **Linux PrivEsc:** SUID binaries, Kernel exploits, Cron jobs. (Tool: **LinPEAS**).

## 🏆 Rules of Success

1.  **Google Dorking:** If you are stuck, search for 15 minutes before asking for help. Google is a skill.
2.  **Take Notes:** Use **Obsidian** or **Notion**. If you don't document it, you didn't learn it.
3.  **Consistency:** 1 hour every day is better than 10 hours on Sunday.
4.  **Ethics:** Never touch a system you do not have permission to test. Jail is not part of the roadmap.
