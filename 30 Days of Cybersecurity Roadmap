# 🛡️ 30 Days of Cybersecurity Roadmap

> A disciplined, hands-on journey from zero to hero in cybersecurity basics.

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository documents my 30-day challenge to learn the fundamentals of cybersecurity. The goal is to build a strong foundation in Linux, Networking, Scripting,
and Web Security through daily practice and labs.

  - IP Addressing, Subnetting, Public vs Private IPs.
- [ ] **Day 5: Ports & Protocols**
  - Common Ports: 21, 22, 53, 80, 443, 3306, 3389.
  - **Lab:** Use Wireshark to analyze a TCP 3-Way Handshake.
- [ ] **Day 6: DNS & HTTP**
  - How DNS resolution works (A, CNAME, MX records).
  - HTTP Methods (GET, POST) & Status Codes (200, 404, 500).

  - Tools: Shodan, Whois, TheHarvester.
- [ ] **Day 12: Active Recon (Nmap)**
  - Scanning types: `-sS`, `-sV`, `-O`.
  - Using Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE).
- [ ] **Day 13: Cryptography Basics**

  - Understanding SQL logic (`' OR 1=1 --`).
  - Manual exploitation on DVWA.
- [ ] **Day 18: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
  - Reflected, Stored, and DOM XSS.
  - PoC: `<script>alert(1)</script>`.
- [ ] **Day 19: Authentication Attacks**
  - Brute Force with Hydra.
  - Cookie Manipulation & Session Hijacking.
- [ ] **Day 20: Command Injection & File Upload**
  - OS Command Injection logic.
