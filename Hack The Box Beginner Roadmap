🧠 Hack The Box Beginner Roadmap

This step-by-step roadmap helps beginners start Hack The Box (HTB) efficiently and build real penetration testing skills without getting stuck early.

🎯 Step 1 — Prepare Your Environment

Before starting machines, set up your lab properly.

✅ What You Need

VPN connection (HTB OpenVPN)

Kali Linux (recommended)

Stable internet connection

Note-taking system (VERY important)

Recommended setup:

Use a dedicated Kali VM

Keep your tools updated

Create a notes folder per machine

💡 HTB is harder than TryHackMe — preparation matters.

🟢 Step 2 — Start With HTB Academy (Strongly Recommended)

If you're new, don’t jump directly into boxes.

👉 Start with HTB Academy modules.

✅ Beginner Modules

Introduction to Academy

Linux Fundamentals

Networking Fundamentals

Web Requests

Introduction to Bash

Information Gathering

Goal: Build the technical foundation needed for real boxes.

🔍 Step 3 — Learn Enumeration Deeply

Enumeration is the #1 skill on Hack The Box.

🔥 Core Commands to Master
nmap -sC -sV -p- <target>
gobuster dir -u http://<target> -w wordlist.txt
ffuf -u http://<target>/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt
enum4linux -a <target>


Focus areas:

Port scanning

Service fingerprinting

Directory brute forcing

SMB enumeration

Web tech identification

🎯 On HTB, most failures = poor enumeration.

💻 Step 4 — Start With Very Easy Boxes

Do NOT start with random machines.

✅ Good Beginner Boxes

Meow

Fawn

Dancing

Appointment

Sequel

Explosion

These are designed for beginners.

What to practice:

Foothold discovery

Basic exploitation

Privilege escalation

Proper methodology

⏱️ Spend time thinking before reading writeups.

🧪 Step 5 — Follow a Structured Box Methodology

For every machine, follow this workflow:

🔄 Standard HTB Workflow

Initial Nmap scan

Service enumeration

Web enumeration (if HTTP)

Foothold exploitation

Local enumeration

Privilege escalation

Proof capture

Write notes

💡 Discipline beats tool spam.

🔴 Step 6 — Move to Easy → Medium Boxes

After finishing several very easy boxes:

👉 Progress gradually:

Very Easy → Easy → Medium

Do NOT rush Medium boxes.

You are ready when:

Enumeration feels natural

You rarely miss open services

You understand why exploits work

🧰 Essential Tools for HTB Beginners

Master these first:

Nmap

Gobuster / FFUF

Burp Suite

Netcat

LinPEAS / WinPEAS

Metasploit (basic usage)

⚠️ Depth > quantity.

📓 Step 7 — Take Professional Notes

For each box, document:

Open ports

Services

Vulnerabilities

Exploitation steps

Privilege escalation path

Lessons learned

Your future self will thank you.
