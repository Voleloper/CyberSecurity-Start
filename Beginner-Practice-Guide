# 🧪 Beginner Practice Guide – Red Team / Pentesting

This guide answers 3 critical beginner questions:

- Which tools should I practice?
- What should I practice with them?
- Which commands must I know?

Goal: build real hands-on skill, not tool memorization.

---

## 🎯 Practice Philosophy

Do NOT try to learn 50 tools.

Learn 5 tools deeply.

Skill comes from repetition, not variety.

Every practice session should follow:

scan → enumerate → exploit → escalate → understand

---

## 🔍 1. Nmap – Network Scanning Practice

Nmap is your most important tool.

### What to practice

- finding open ports
- identifying services
- reading scan results
- detecting attack surface

### Commands you must know

```
nmap <target>
nmap -sC -sV <target>
nmap -p- <target>
nmap -A <target>
nmap -T4 <target>
nmap --script vuln <target>
```

### Practice exercises

- scan your own VM
- scan lab machines
- compare fast vs full scans
- interpret service versions
- guess possible exploits

Goal: read nmap output like a story.

## 🌐 2. Gobuster – Directory Discovery Practice

Used for web reconnaissance.

### What to practice

- discovering hidden directories
- wordlist usage
- interpreting HTTP responses

### Commands

```
gobuster dir -u http://target -w wordlist.txt
gobuster dir -x php,txt,html -u http://target -w wordlist.txt
```

### Practice exercises

- find hidden admin panels
- discover backup files
- analyze response codes
- map website structure

Goal: think like a web attacker.

---

## 🔐 3. Hydra – Password Attack Practice

Learn authentication weaknesses.

### What to practice

- brute force logic
- login behavior
- credential testing

### Commands

```
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt ssh://target
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt ftp://target
hydra -t 4 -V ssh://target
```

### Practice exercises

- attack a test SSH service
- simulate weak password policies
- observe lockout behavior

Goal: understand authentication risk.

---

## 🧰 4. Metasploit – Exploitation Practice

Framework for structured exploitation.

### What to practice

- searching exploits
- configuring payloads
- managing sessions

### Commands

```
msfconsole
search <service>
use <exploit>
show options
set RHOST <target>
set LHOST <your-ip>
run
sessions
```

### Practice exercises

- exploit vulnerable machines
- open reverse shells
- interact with sessions
- background sessions

Goal: understand exploitation workflow.

---

## 🧠 5. Linux Privilege Escalation Practice

Critical real-world skill.

### What to practice

- weak permissions
- SUID binaries
- sudo misconfigurations
- writable files

### Commands

```
sudo -l
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
cat /etc/passwd
linpeas.sh
```

### Practice exercises

- escalate from user → root
- analyze permissions
- find misconfigured services

Goal: turn small access into full control.

---

## 🧪 How to Practice Safely

You must use legal environments.

Recommended setup:

- virtual machine lab
- local vulnerable machines
- CTF-style challenges
- intentionally insecure systems

Never attack random internet targets.

---

## 🔁 Daily Practice Routine

Beginner training loop:

1. Scan a machine
2. Enumerate services
3. Find a vulnerability
4. Exploit it
5. Escalate privileges
6. Document what happened

Repeat daily.

Consistency builds skill.

---

## 🎯 Beginner Milestone Checklist

You are improving if you can:

✅ read nmap output confidently  
✅ discover hidden web paths  
✅ brute force a weak login  
✅ exploit a vulnerability  
✅ escalate privileges  
✅ explain the attack chain  

Understanding > tool usage.
