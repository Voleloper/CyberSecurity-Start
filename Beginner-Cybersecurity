# 🐧 Linux & Cyber Security – Beginner Guide

This repository is a beginner-friendly guide to learning Linux from a cyber security perspective.

Goal:  
Learn Linux from scratch and understand how it is used in real-world security.

This guide is written for people with **no prior Linux experience**.  
It is technical, but easy to follow.

## 🎯 Why Learn Linux for Cyber Security?

Linux is the foundation of modern cyber security.

Penetration testing, server administration, log analysis, network inspection —  
most real security work happens on Linux systems.

Learning Linux helps you:

- master the terminal
- understand how operating systems work
- develop an attacker mindset
- automate tasks
- think like a security engineer

You cannot become strong in cyber security without Linux.

## 🧠 Beginner Learning Goals

This repository aims to help you:

✅ Use the terminal confidently  
✅ Understand the Linux file system  
✅ Learn the permission model  
✅ Monitor running processes  
✅ Use basic networking tools  
✅ Write simple automation scripts

## 📂 Understanding the Linux File System

In Linux, everything is a file.

Important directories:

```
/home     → user files
/etc      → system configuration
/var/log  → log files
/tmp      → temporary files
/root     → admin directory
/bin      → essential commands
```

Understanding this structure = understanding the system.

## ⚡ Essential Terminal Commands

### File Operations

```
pwd        → show current directory
ls         → list files
cd         → change directory
mkdir      → create folder
rm         → delete file
cp         → copy file
mv         → move/rename file
```

---

### Reading Files

```
cat file.txt
less file.txt
head file.txt
tail file.txt
```

These are heavily used in log analysis.

---

### Permission System

```
ls -l
chmod 755 file
chown user file
sudo command
```

Linux security is built around permissions.

---

### User Information

```
whoami
id
groups
sudo -l
```

Critical for understanding privilege escalation.

---

### Process Monitoring

```
ps aux
top
htop
kill <pid>
```

Seeing what runs on a system is a key security skill.

---

### Networking Commands

```
ip a
ping <ip>
netstat -tulnp
ss -tulnp
tcpdump
```

You cannot understand hacking without networking.

---

## 🔍 Beginner Security Tools

Starter tools for learning:

```
nmap        → port scanning
nikto       → web vulnerability scanning
hydra       → brute force testing
gobuster    → directory discovery
wireshark   → network analysis
```

The goal is not memorizing tools —  
the goal is understanding what they do.

---

## 🧪 Practice Environment

The best way to learn is hands-on.

Recommended setup:

- install a virtual machine
- install a Linux distribution
- create test environments
- solve labs and CTF challenges

You don’t learn security by reading.  
You learn by doing.

## 🧠 Learning Strategy

1. Don’t memorize commands → use them
2. Break things → fix them
3. Read logs
4. Explore the system
5. Stay in the terminal

Learning Linux is like building muscle.  
Repetition creates
