Day 14: Pivoting Foundations: SSH Tunneling, Local/Remote/Dynamic Port Forwarding (Proxychains).

Week 3: Security Scripting (Python & Go)

Days 15-17: Python for Offense: Build a multithreaded Port Scanner and a Scapy-based ARP Spoofer.

Days 18-20: Go for Security: Understanding static binaries and concurrency. Build a "Subdomain Enumerator" or a "Directory Brute-forcer."

Day 21: Automation: Interacting with REST APIs for automated OSINT and vulnerability scanning.

Week 4: Windows Internals & PowerUser Skills

Days 22-24: Windows Core: Processes, Threads, Handles, DLL Injection concepts, and the Windows Registry.

Days 25-27: Active Directory 101: NTDS.dit, Kerberos flow (AS-REQ, TGS, TGT), and LDAP queries.

Days 28-30: PowerShell for Pentesters: Bypassing Execution Policies, using Invoke-Expression, and PowerShell Remoting (WinRM).

🛠️ Phase 2: Vulnerability Analysis & Exploitation (Days 31-60)
Focus: Finding flaws and weaponizing them.

Week 5: Advanced Web Hacking

Days 31-33: SSRF & XXE: Server-Side Request Forgery and XML External Entity exploitation.

Days 34-35: Insecure Deserialization: Exploiting object serialization in Java/PHP/Python for RCE.

Days 36-37: Logic Flaws: IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) and Race Conditions in business logic.

Week 6: Binary Exploitation (Exploit Dev)

Days 38-40: Assembly (x86/x64): Learning the Stack, Heap, and Registers (EAX, ESP, EIP).

Days 41-44: Stack-Based Buffer Overflow: Using GDB or Immunity Debugger to control EIP, find JMP ESP, and execute shellcode.

Week 7: Active Directory Red Teaming

Days 45-47: Initial Access: LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning (Responder), Password Spraying, and SMB Relay attacks.

Days 48-50: Lateral Movement: Pass-the-Hash (PtH), Pass-the-Ticket (PtT), and Overpass-the-Hash via Mimikatz.

Day 51: Domain Persistence: Golden Ticket and Silver Ticket creation.

Week 8: Privilege Escalation (The Art of Escalation)

Days 52-54: Linux PrivEsc: Wildcard exploitation, PATH hijacking, Cron Job abuse, and Kernel exploits.

Days 55-57: Windows PrivEsc: Unquoted Service Paths, Token Manipulation, and Potato-style (PrintSpoofer) exploits.

Days 58-60: Post-Exploitation: Credential harvesting, pillaging sensitive files, and Data Exfiltration.

🚀 Phase 3: Defensive Ops, Labs & Professionalism (Days 61-90)
Focus: Blue teaming, certification readiness, and career building.

Week 9: Offensive Labs (CTF Marathon)

Days 61-67: Solve 5 "Hard" machines on HackTheBox or Proving Grounds. Write a professional "Vulnerability Assessment Report" for each.

Week 10: Cloud & Modern Infra

Days 68-70: Cloud Security: AWS/Azure S3 Bucket misconfigurations and IAM Role abuse.

Days 71-74: Container Security: Docker escapes and Kubernetes (K8s) misconfiguration audits.

Week 11: Blue Team & Threat Hunting

Days 75-77: SIEM Analysis: Using ELK Stack or Splunk to detect the attacks you performed in Phase 2.

Days 78-80: Detection Engineering: Write YARA rules for malware and Sigma rules for SIEM alerts.

Day 81: Incident Response: Basics of Digital Forensics and Log correlation.

Week 12: Professional Polish & Certification

Days 82-85: Portfolio Finalization: Publish your "Pentest Toolbox" on GitHub. Share PoCs for CVEs you studied.

Days 86-88: 24-Hour Mock Exam: Simulate an OSCP/PNPT exam by attempting 5 machines in one sitting.

Days 89-90: Career Readiness: Technical Resume (CV) optimization and LinkedIn networking with industry experts.
