1. General & Foundational Concepts (Temel Kavramlar)

Bu sorular, siber güvenlik anlayışının temelini ölçmek için sorulur.

** Q1: Explain the CIA Triad. Why is it important?
A: The CIA Triad is the fundamental model for information security organization.

Confidentiality: Ensuring that data is accessed only by authorized personnel (e.g., Encryption, MFA).

Integrity: Ensuring that data has not been tampered with or altered (e.g., Hashing, File Integrity Monitoring).

Availability: Ensuring that systems and data are accessible when needed (e.g., Redundancy, DDoS protection).
It is important because every security control or policy ultimately maps back to one of these three principles.

** Q2: What is the difference between Vulnerability, Threat, and Risk?
A:

Vulnerability: A weakness or gap in a security program that can be exploited (e.g., an unpatched server).

Threat: A potential event or actor that can exploit a vulnerability (e.g., a hacker or malware).

Risk: The potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability. Formula: Risk=Threat×Vulnerability×AssetValue.

** Q3: How do you stay updated with the latest cybersecurity news and trends?
(Note: This is a critical behavioral question.)
A: I follow trusted sources like The Hacker News, Krebs on Security, and BleepingComputer. I also check CVE databases regularly, follow key security researchers on Twitter/X, and listen to podcasts like Darknet Diaries. Recently, I've been reading about [Mention a recent topic, e.g., AI-driven phishing or a specific ransomware group].

2. Network Security (Ağ Güvenliği)

Ağ temelleri siber güvenliğin belkemiğidir.

** Q4: Explain the TCP 3-Way Handshake.
A: It is the process used to establish a connection between a client and a server over a TCP/IP network.

SYN: The client sends a packet with the SYN (Synchronize) flag set to initiate a connection.

SYN-ACK: The server acknowledges the packet and responds with a SYN-ACK flag.

ACK: The client sends an ACK packet to confirm the connection is established.

** Q5: What is the difference between IDS and IPS?
A:

IDS (Intrusion Detection System): Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and sends alerts. It is passive and does not stop the attack.

IPS (Intrusion Prevention System): sits in-line with traffic, monitors for suspicious activity, and can actively block or drop packets to prevent the attack.

** Q6: What is a DDoS attack and how can you mitigate it?
A: A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack overwhelms a target server or network with a flood of traffic from multiple compromised sources (botnet) to make it unavailable.
Mitigation:

Implementing Rate Limiting.

Using a WAF (Web Application Firewall).

Using Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) like Cloudflare or Akamai to absorb traffic.

Blackhole routing (dropping traffic at the ISP level).

3. Web Application Security (Uygulama Güvenliği)

Genellikle OWASP Top 10 üzerinden gidilir.

** Q7: What is SQL Injection (SQLi) and how do you prevent it?
A: SQLi occurs when an attacker interferes with the queries an application makes to its database, allowing them to view or modify data.
Prevention:

Primary Defense: Use Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries). This ensures the database treats user input as data, not executable code.

Input Validation and Sanitization.

Principle of Least Privilege for database accounts.

** Q8: Explain Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
A: XSS allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts (usually JavaScript) into web pages viewed by other users.

Stored XSS: The script is permanently stored on the target server (e.g., in a forum post).

Reflected XSS: The script is reflected off the web server, usually via a malicious link.

DOM-based XSS: The vulnerability exists in the client-side code rather than the server-side code.

** Q9: What is the difference between XSS and CSRF?
A:

XSS (Cross-Site Scripting): The attacker runs their script on the victim's browser to steal cookies or session tokens. (Focus: Stealing data/access).

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery): The attacker tricks the victim into performing an unwanted action on a web application where they are currently authenticated (e.g., changing a password or transferring money). (Focus: Forcing an action).

4. Incident Response & Malware Analysis (Olay Müdahale)

** Q10: What are the phases of Incident Response (according to NIST)?
A:

Preparation: Training, tools, and policy creation.

Detection & Analysis: Monitoring logs, identifying the incident, and determining scope.

Containment, Eradication, & Recovery: Stopping the spread (disconnecting from network), removing the threat (re-imaging), and restoring services.

Post-Incident Activity: Lessons learned and report writing to improve future response.

** Q11: You discover a compromised workstation on the corporate network. What is your immediate reaction?
A:

Isolate: Immediately disconnect the machine from the network (physically or logically) to prevent lateral movement.

Preserve Evidence: Do not shut down the machine if possible, to preserve RAM artifacts.

Triage: Analyze logs to understand the entry point and scope.

Report: Escalate to the Incident Response Lead or Management.

** Q12: How does Ransomware work and what is the best defense against it?
A: Ransomware encrypts the victim's files and demands payment for the decryption key.
Best Defense:

Backups: Regular, offline (air-gapped) backups are the only 100% guarantee recovery method.

Endpoint Protection: EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solutions.

User Awareness: Training users to recognize phishing emails (the most common delivery method).

5. Cryptography (Kriptografi)

** Q13: What is the difference between Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption?
A:

Symmetric Encryption: Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. It is faster but requires secure key exchange (e.g., AES).

Asymmetric Encryption: Uses a pair of keys (Public and Private). The public key encrypts, and the private key decrypts. It is slower but solves the key exchange problem (e.g., RSA, ECC).

** Q14: What is Hashing and how is it different from Encryption?
A:

Hashing: A one-way function that converts data into a fixed-size string (digest). It cannot be reversed. Used for integrity checks and password storage (e.g., SHA-256).

Encryption: A two-way function intended to be reversed (decrypted) with a key. Used for confidentiality.

** Q15: Why should you salt passwords before hashing them?
A: Salting involves adding a random string of characters to the password before hashing. This defends against Rainbow Table attacks (pre-computed hash tables) by making every password hash unique, even if two users have the same password.

6. Scenario & "Think Like a Hacker" (Senaryo Soruları)

** Q16: If you had to secure a coffee shop's public Wi-Fi, what would you do?
A:

Isolate the guest network from the internal business network (VLANs).

Enable Client Isolation (AP Isolation) so devices cannot communicate with each other.

Use WPA3 if supported, or WPA2 with strong passwords.

Implement a Captive Portal with Terms of Service.

Change default router admin credentials.

** Q17: I type 'https://www.google.com/search?q=google.com' into my browser and hit enter. Describe what happens from a security perspective.
A: (Recruiters love this because it tests full-stack knowledge)

DNS Resolution: The browser checks cache, then queries DNS servers. (Security risk: DNS Spoofing).

TCP Handshake: Connection established.

TLS Handshake: The browser validates Google's SSL/TLS certificate to ensure authenticity and negotiates encryption keys. (Prevents Man-in-the-Middle attacks).

HTTP Request/Response: Encrypted data is transferred.
