Linux is the foundation of modern cyber security operations.  
This repository documents essential Linux knowledge required for:

- penetration testing
- incident response
- system hardening
- network analysis
- privilege escalation
- security automation

The goal is to build **real-world operational Linux skills**.

---

## ⚙️ Core Linux Skills

### 🔐 Permissions & Privilege Model

Understanding Linux permissions is critical for security:

- UID / GID architecture
- rwx permission model
- SUID / SGID / sticky bit
- sudo configuration
- `/etc/passwd` & `/etc/shadow` analysis

---

### 🧠 Process & System Monitoring

Detecting abnormal behavior requires system visibility:

- process tree analysis
- daemon management
- systemd services
- kernel log inspection
- signal handling (SIGTERM / SIGKILL)

---

### 🌐 Networking & Traffic Analysis

Linux networking stack enables deep inspection:

- socket analysis
- routing tables
- firewall rules
- packet capture
- port monitoring

---

### 🤖 Automation & Shell Scripting

Automation is mandatory in security operations:

- Bash scripting
- cron scheduling
- log parsing
- scanning automation
- monitoring scripts

---

## 🔴 Offensive Security Usage

Linux is the standard platform for red team operations:

- exploit development
- payload generation
- lateral movement
- persistence techniques
- privilege escalation

---

## 🔵 Defensive Security Usage

Linux powers defensive infrastructure:

- server hardening
- intrusion detection
- forensic analysis
- log centralization
- SIEM integration

---
