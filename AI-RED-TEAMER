# 🤖 AI Red Teamer Mode

This section documents how an AI-assisted red team workflow can be used to simulate real-world adversary behavior.

The goal is not automation for laziness —  
the goal is **automation for scale, speed, and precision**.

AI is used as a force multiplier.

## 🎯 Red Team Philosophy

A real red teamer thinks like an attacker:

- enumerate everything
- trust nothing
- assume misconfiguration
- chain small weaknesses into full compromise
- maintain stealth
- persist access
- exfiltrate quietly

AI accelerates decision-making but does not replace skill.

Human judgment > automation.

## 🔴 AI-Assisted Red Team Workflow

### 1. Reconnaissance

AI helps interpret scan results faster.

```
nmap -sC -sV -p- <target>
gobuster dir -u http://target -w wordlist.txt
whois <domain>
dig <domain>
```

Focus:

- exposed services
- outdated versions
- hidden directories
- attack surface mapping

---

### 2. Enumeration

Deep service inspection:

```
enum4linux <target>
smbclient -L //<target>
rpcclient -U "" <target>
```

Web enumeration:

```
nikto -h http://target
wfuzz -c -z file,wordlist.txt http://target/FUZZ
```

AI assists in:

- interpreting misconfigurations
- suggesting exploit paths
- prioritizing attack vectors

---

### 3. Exploitation

```
searchsploit <service>
msfconsole
use <exploit>
set RHOST <target>
run
```

Manual exploitation preferred when possible.

AI role:

- exploit analysis
- payload crafting
- error debugging

---

### 4. Privilege Escalation

Linux enumeration:

```
linpeas.sh
sudo -l
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
cat /etc/passwd
```

Key checks:

- SUID binaries
- writable cron jobs
- weak sudo rules
- kernel exploits

---

### 5. Persistence

```
crontab -e
echo "ssh-rsa ..." >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
useradd backdoor
```

Goal:

- survive reboot
- avoid detection
- maintain covert access

---

### 6. Lateral Movement

```
ssh user@host
scp payload user@host:/tmp
proxychains nmap <internal-ip>
```

AI helps map internal networks and pivot strategies.

## ⚡ Red Team Mindset Checklist

- Did I enumerate everything?
- Did I check default creds?
- Did I inspect configs?
- Did I escalate privileges?
- Can I persist access?
- Can I move laterally?
- Can I exfiltrate data quietly?

If not → keep digging.

## 🧠 AI Red Team Principle

AI is a tactical assistant.

It speeds up:

- log analysis
- exploit research
- payload generation
- enumeration interpretation
- strategy brainstorming

But:

⚠️ AI does not hack.  
⚠️ The operator hacks.

Skill > tools.
