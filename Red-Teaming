# 🔴 Red Teaming – Beginner Guide

This repository is a beginner-friendly introduction to Red Teaming.

Goal:  
Understand how real adversaries operate and learn the foundational skills required for red team operations.

No experience required — but curiosity is mandatory.

---

## 🎯 What is Red Teaming?

Red Teaming is the simulation of real-world attackers.

Unlike basic penetration testing, red teaming focuses on:

- stealth
- persistence
- adversary behavior
- long-term access
- detection evasion
- realistic attack chains

A red team does not just find vulnerabilities.  
A red team behaves like an attacker.

## 🧠 Core Red Team Skills

A beginner red teamer must build strong fundamentals:

✅ Linux mastery  
✅ Networking knowledge  
✅ Windows internals  
✅ Active Directory basics  
✅ Scripting (Bash / Python / PowerShell)  
✅ Operating system security  
✅ Web fundamentals  
✅ Problem-solving mindset  

Tools come after understanding.

## ⚡ Red Team Attack Lifecycle

Real red team operations follow phases.

---

### 1. Reconnaissance

Gather external intelligence.

```
nmap -sC -sV <target>
whois <domain>
dig <domain>
gobuster dir -u http://target -w wordlist.txt
```

Goal: map the environment.

---

### 2. Initial Access

Find an entry point.

```
hydra ssh://target
sqlmap -u "URL"
searchsploit <service>
msfconsole
```

Goal: foothold in the system.

---

### 3. Privilege Escalation

Increase access level.

```
sudo -l
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
linpeas.sh
```

Goal: user → administrator/root.

---

### 4. Persistence

Maintain access over time.

```
crontab -e
authorized_keys modification
user creation
```

Goal: survive reboots and detection.

---

### 5. Lateral Movement

Move inside the network.

```
ssh user@internal-ip
proxychains nmap <internal-range>
scp payload host:/tmp
```

Goal: expand control.

---

### 6. Data Exfiltration

Extract valuable information quietly.

Goal: simulate real attacker impact.

---

## 🧰 Beginner Red Team Tools

```
nmap        → reconnaissance
metasploit  → exploitation framework
burpsuite   → web attacks
hydra       → credential attacks
gobuster    → discovery
impacket    → AD/network attacks
wireshark   → traffic inspection
```

Tools assist — mindset wins.

---

## 🧪 Safe Practice Environment

Red teaming must be practiced legally.

Recommended:

- home lab (virtual machines)
- intentionally vulnerable systems
- security lab platforms
- CTF environments

Never attack real systems without permission.

---

## 🧠 Beginner Strategy

1. Master Linux terminal
2. Learn networking deeply
3. Understand Windows & Active Directory
4. Practice privilege escalation
5. Break lab machines
6. Read red team writeups
7. Repeat constantly

Skill is built through repetition.

---

## 🎯 Beginner Milestones

You are progressing if you can:

✅ gain initial access  
✅ escalate privileges  
✅ maintain persistence  
✅ pivot to another system  
✅ explain the attack chain  

Understanding > tool usage.

---

## 🔥 Red Team Mindset

Think like an attacker:

- assume misconfiguration
- trust nothing
- enumerate everything
- chain small weaknesses
- stay quiet
- persist access

Patience is a weapon.
